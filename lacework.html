      <h2>The intern experience</h2>
      <p>In summer 2021, I had the opportunity to work with the wonderful team at Lacework, a cloud security company
        based in the Bay Area. It was an amazing time working with passionate and experienced designers, hearing about
        their experiences designing for security, and sharing my own experiences as a new designer. As I worked through
        the complexities of cloud security, remote work, and designing in a formal environment, I grew not only as a
        designer, but as a collaborator, a learner, and a communicator.</p>

      <h2>Lacework's reports workflow</h2>
      <p>Many of Lacework's customers use PDF and CSV reports to share their security status with others in the company.
        For the 12 weeks of my internship, I worked with my design supervisor and our project PM to restructure
        Lacework's reports system, creating a centralized workflow where thousands of security executives across
        hundreds of Lacework's customers can preview, customize, and edit reports to suit their needs.</p>
      <!-- <p>Throughout the internship, I saw my project unfold from simple concept wireframes to a full fletched migration plan to the engineering team. It was rewarding to see a page in Lacework's navigation dedicated to reports and how many people across different teams that were excited for my work as an intern.</p> -->
      <p>While I cannot share what I worked on publicly, feel free to take a look at the general rundown of my design
        process! If you are a job recruiter, I've included a password to the full case study on my resume. Feel free to
        reach out to me for a password or a chat about this project at joyceshen0@gmail.com!</p>

      <h2>Dark Mode</h2>
      <p>Despite dark mode being a popular choice among our customers, Lacework's dark mode currently works by inverting
        light mode colors, leaving strange drop shadows, poor separation of elements, and accessibility issues. As a
        side project, I researched and overhauled colors and styles for Lacework's dark mode component library.</p>

      <h2>Leading a design workshop at BRIDGEGOOD</h2>
      <p>During my internship, our UX team had the opportunity to hold a three-day workshop with BRIDGEGOOD, a nonprofit
        providing design education and opportunities to design students of color. We conducted two remote lectures,
        where I discussed user research and user personas and assisted in a user interview exercise, and also held an
        in-person workshop where I guided students on creating affinity diagrams.</p>

      <h2>A step forward</h2>
      <p>I had a really rewarding time at Lacework, and I couldn't have asked for a better environment to foster my
        growth as a designer. Working in an open and collaborative space helped me develop a new mindset to approaching
        design, one that allows room for uncertainty, input, and improvement.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>
      <h3>Being lost is a part of growth, so embrace it. </h3>
      <p>Cloud security is confusing. Even the senior designers on my team who had years of experience with cloud
        security admitted that they were learning new things about the field every day. When I first started the
        internship, I was uncomfortable with the amount of uncertainty I was facing. But as I spent more time in
        meetings and speaking to Lacework employees, I began to embrace the delight in learning something new, handling
        failure, and asking dumb questions. I found enjoyment in being lost and having a whole world to explore in front
        of me.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>
      <h3>Everyone is a part of the design team.</h3>
      <p>Though our design team and product team contributed substantially to our reports project, some of the best
        ideas came from our engineering team, which brought a new perspective to the logistics behind each screen, and
        our customer success team, which had a better understanding of customer needs for our project. Everyone brought
        their own knowledge and ideas to our design, and that's what made it work.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <p>The compliments I was showered with after my final presentation boosted my confidence in myself as a designer.
        Lacework was my first leap in my path to becoming a professional designer, and an experience I will cherish for
        a long time. Thank you to Jayati, Matt, Lindsey, Yizhou, Rutuja, and Shruti for making this experience the best
        it could ever be! &#128153;</p>
