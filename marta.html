<h1>The problem with MARTA On the Go</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>MARTA, Atlanta's public transportation system, strives to make transportation more accessible and seamless for people living in Atlanta. For transit systems as large as MARTA, a big factor of accessibility is having a reliable platform to help users with scheduling trips. While MARTA currently has an app called MARTA On the Go that gives real-time arrivals and schedules, it is outdated and difficult to use, as seen from the app screenshots below. For this project for a design bootcamp, my partner and I wanted to improve the design of the rail schedule section of the app.</p>

<h1>User research</h1>
<div class="post-title-br"></div>


<p>To get different perspectives on people's experiences with the MARTA app, we interviewed eight people: four people who use MARTA regularly and four Atlanta visitors who had only used MARTA once or twice. We compiled and organized our main findings on this <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/u0JeLawyz206kZJvFp9Uyv/MARTA-Affinity-Diagram?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">affinity diagram</a>.</p>
<p>In general, regular MARTA passengers were frustrated with the app's outdated UI and lack of information on delays. First-time MARTA passengers were confused about how long it would take to get from one station to another, and where they were during a trip.</p>


<div class="med-br"></div>


<h2>Quotes</h2>
<div class="one-third-gallery">

    <div><p>"I had to check the MARTA Twitter [for delay information]... but I wish these same alerts were on the app."</p></div>

    <div><p>"Maybe if you lived in Atlanta, you'd be more accustomed to it, but I just wasn't used to it."</p></div>

    <div><p>"Overall, I really like MARTA, I just wish that the website/ app would reflect the art and culture that's so defining of Atlanta."</p></div>

</div>


<div class="med-br"></div>


<h2>Key findings</h2>
<div class="one-third-gallery">
  <div>
    <p><b>Usability issues</b></p>
    <p>Information on the app is cluttered and difficult to navigate, making it hard to find schedules or plan trips.</p>

    <p><b>Delay alerts</b></p>
    <p>Passengers aren't alerted when rail lines are delayed or facing issues.</p>

<h1>Designing for two audiences</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

    <p>From our interviews, we found that regular MARTA passengers had much different needs from first-time MARTA passengers. <!--Regular passengers needed quick access to real-time arrival information and delay alerts. First-time passengers/Atlanta visitors needed guidance on how to plan their trips, go through transfers, and where to enter and exit a station.</p>
    <p>-->A goal for us was to figure out how to fit the needs of both user groups without overcomplicating the app. We created two user personas and a journey map to get a better understanding of the user groups.</p>

<br>


<div class="extra-width-img"><img src="media/marta/user-personas-journey-map.png"></div>

<br>

  <p>Our personas emphasized struggles with delays, navigation, and ease of use. Based off of this, we decided the best way to improve regular MARTA passengers' experience was to put a map, real-time alerts, and delay alerts all on the home screen of the app for easy navigability. For Atlanta visitors, we added a trip planner to the app that would walk them through getting from one station to another.</p>

<h1>User flows</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

  <h2>Compare and contrast flow</h2>
  <p>We brainstormed and diagrammed a new user flow for the app (blue), and compared it with the current user flow (red). Our new flow was able to simplify the app so that users could access most screens in a few clicks.</p>
<br>
<div class="extra-width-img"><img src="media/marta/compare-contrast-flow.png"></div>


<div class="med-br"></div>

  <h2>Persona flow</h2>
  <p>We created another user flow for how our personas would navigate through the app.</p>

     data-aos-offset="325"
     data-aos-duration="500">

<h1>Wireframes</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

  <p>Using our user flows, we created wireframes for four screens on the app: the home screen, schedules, search results, and trip planner. We took inspiration from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.bart.gov/planner" target="_blank">BART's (Bay Area Rapid Transit) trip planner</a>, and other transit app design mockups to structure our screens in a logical way for users.</p>

<br>

<div class="extra-width-img"><img src="media/marta/wireframes1.png"></div>

<div class="med-br"></div>

  <p>We received some suggestions to increase the emphasis on alerts in the home screen and improve the way users select their station/direction on the schedule timetable.</p>

<h1>Visual design</h1>
<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>A big issue that a lot of interviewees had with the current app was the poor visual design. To make the app as clean as possible, we agreed on a simple, light-themed design using a single font, Arimo, and colors taken from MARTA's system map. We also decided to incorporate shapes from <a href="https://www.itsmarta.com/" target="_blank">MARTA's logo</a> to help tie things together and emphasize the branding.</p>

<h1>Next steps</h1>
<div class="post-title-br"></div>

  <p>We presented our mockups at an expo for our design bootcamp, and were able to get a lot of positive and constructive feedback on our app and on our presentation.</p>

<br>

<div class="full-width-img"><img src="media/marta/feedback.png"></div>

<br>

    <p>Based off our feedback, the next steps for our project are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixing the trip planner so that users can enter any location, not just the name of a station</li>
      <li>Improving the layout of the schedule/timetable to improve usability</li>
      <li>Incorporating streetcar and bus schedules into the app</li>
      <li>Designing an onboarding process for regular MARTA users to enter their usual stations</li>
    </ul>

<h1>What I learned</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>Working on this project has been a really great chance for me to practice redesigning an existing app. Many of my previous projects involved me designing something from scratch, so having the structure of the current MARTA app was both a benefit and a challenge. We had to spend some time looking at the current app, to find what features should be emphasized, what features needed to be hidden, and what features should be added or removed.</p>

<p>I also had a really great experience working with my partner, Karis. She had really great ideas and also a great working style, being meticulous and consistent with her designs but never getting caught up in details. Working with her has taught me a lot to improve my own working style.</p>
