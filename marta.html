    <h1>Improving the public transit experience for Atlanta residents</h1>
    <div class="mobile-br"></div>
    <p>MARTA, Atlanta's public transportation system, strives to make transportation more accessible and seamless for people living in Atlanta. As a part of a design bootcamp, my partner and I looked for ways to uphold this goal by improving its transit app, MARTA On The Go.</p>
    <div class="mobile-br"></div>

<h1>The current app</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>For transit systems as large as MARTA, a big factor of accessibility is having a reliable platform to help users with scheduling trips. While the current MARTA On the Go app gives real-time arrivals and schedules, it is outdated and difficult to use.</p>
<br>
<div class="full-width-img"><img src="media/marta/old-marta.png" alt="Old MARTA"></div>




<div class="big-br"></div>




<h1>User research</h1>
<div class="post-title-br"></div>

  <p>To get different perspectives on MARTA and MARTA's app, we conducted 30 minute interviews with eight people: four who use MARTA regularly and four Atlanta visitors who had only used MARTA once or twice. Our interviewees discussed the lack of delay alerts, usability issues with the app, and struggles with planning trips. These are a few quotes that summarize their experiences.</p>

  <div class="quote-box">
    <span class="quote-mark">“</span>
    <p>"I had to check the MARTA Twitter [for delay information]... but <b>I wish these same
      alerts were on the app</b>."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="quote-box">
    <span class="quote-mark">“</span>
    <p>"Overall, I really like MARTA, I just wish that the website/app would <b>reflect the art and culture</b> that's so
      defining of Atlanta."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="quote-box">
    <span class="quote-mark">“</span>
    <p>"Maybe if you lived in Atlanta, you'd be more accustomed to it, but <b>I just wasn't
      used to it</b>."</p>
  </div>

<div class="med-br"></div>


<h2>Key findings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Information on the app is <b>cluttered and difficult to navigate</b>, making it hard to find schedules or plan trips.</li>
<li>Passengers aren't alerted when rail lines are <b>delayed or facing issues</b>.</li>
<li>The app's <b>poor visual design</b> discourages regular use.</li>
</ul>


<div class="med-br"></div>

<h2>User personas + Journey map</h2>
<p>From our interviews, we found that regular MARTA passengers had much different needs from first-time MARTA passengers. Regular passengers needed quick access to real-time arrival information and delay alerts. First-time passengers needed guidance on how to plan and go through their trips. We created two user personas and a journey map to reflect the sentiments of our user groups.

<div class="big-br"></div>




<h1>User flows</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>We decided the best way to improve regular MARTA passengers' experience was to put a map, real-time alerts, and delay alerts all on the home screen of the app for easy navigability. For Atlanta visitors, we thought of adding a trip planner that would walk them through getting from one station to another.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we diagrammed a compare-and-contrast user flow, comparing the app's current user flow (red) to our new one (blue). Our new flow was able to simplify the app so that users could access most screens in a few clicks. We also created a persona user flow for how our personas would navigate through the app.</p>

<div class="big-br"></div>




<h1>Wireframes</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

  <p>Using our user flows, we created wireframes for four screens on the app: the home screen, schedules, search results, and trip planner. We took inspiration from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.bart.gov/planner" target="_blank">BART's (Bay Area Rapid Transit) trip planner</a>, and other transit app designs to structure our screens in a logical way for users.</p>

<br>

<div class="full-width-img"><img src="media/marta/wireframes1.png" alt="Wireframes"></div>

<div class="med-br"></div>

  <p>We received some suggestions to increase the emphasis on alerts in the home screen and improve the way users select their station/direction on the schedule timetable.</p>

<br>

<div class="big-br"></div>




<h1>Visual design</h1>
<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>A big issue that a lot of interviewees had with the current app was the poor visual design. To make the app as clean as possible, we agreed on a simple, light-themed design, incorporating colors and shapes from MARTA's logo to help emphasize the branding.</p>

<h1>The solution</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<div class="uneven-gallery">
  <div style="width:60.8%">
    <h2>Home Screen + Arrival Times</h2>
    <p>Users see a map and list of nearby stations. Information on real-time arrivals and delay alerts can be accessed by clicking on a station in the map or list.</p>

<div class="uneven-gallery">
  <div style="width:60.8%">
    <h2>Timetables</h2>
    <p>Rather than scrolling through lists of timetables on the current app, users select their desired date, rail line, and direction to get a table of estimated arrival times.</p>

  <div style="width:60.8%">
    <h2>Search Results</h2>
    <p>Users can search for a station from the home screen, and click on each station for real-time arrival information. They can then choose to view the station on the map.</p>

    <h2>Trip Planner</h2>
    <p>Users can plan a trip by entering their departure locations, arrival locations, and departure/arrival times into the trip planner. They will receive a list of route options and can save the itinerary to a list of trips.</p>

<h1>Next steps</h1>
<div class="post-title-br"></div>

  <p>We presented our mockups at an expo for our design bootcamp, where people were able to test a prototype of our app and give us feedback.<!--</p>

<br>

<div class="full-width-img"><img src="media/marta/feedback.png"></div>

<br>

    <p>--> Based on the feedback, the next steps for our project are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixing the trip planner so that users can enter any location, not just the name of a station</li>
      <li>Improving the layout of the schedule/timetable to improve usability</li>
      <li>Incorporating streetcar and bus schedules into the app</li>
      <li>Designing an onboarding process for regular MARTA users to enter their usual stations</li>
    </ul>




<div class="big-br"></div>




<h1>What I learned</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>Working on this project has been a really great chance for me to practice redesigning an existing app. Many of my previous projects involved me designing something from scratch, so having the structure of the current MARTA app was both a benefit and a challenge. We had to spend some time looking at the current app, to find what features should be emphasized, what features needed to be hidden, and what features should be added or removed.</p>

<p>I also had a really great experience working with my partner, Karis. She had many good ideas and a nice working style, being meticulous and consistent with her designs but never getting caught up in details. Working with her has helped me improve my own working style. Overall, it was really fun to work together and learn a lot of new things through this project!</p>
