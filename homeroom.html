  <h1>Bridging the gap between online and in-person collaboration</h1>
  <div class="mobile-br"></div>
  <p>With the shift to virtual education during the pandemic, my team and I decided to create a tool that improves virtual collaboration experiences in classrooms.</p>
  <div class="mobile-br"></div>

<h1>The problem</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>This year, a lot of students and teachers have been thrown into virtual learning with little prior training or notice. Because of the transition, a lot of changes have been made to the way classes operate. Collaboration is an integral tool in classrooms, especially when students and teachers are living more isolated lives, but current technologies for virtual learning don't allow for the same collaborative experience that students get in classrooms.</p>

<h1>User research</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>To create a helpful collaboration tool, we had to get a better understanding of our main stakeholders: students, teachers, and administrators. <b>We observed 4, interviewed 5, and surveyed 62 people across these stakeholder categories, comparing their online and in-person classroom experiences.</b> We also did competitive analysis on a few video conferencing and collaboration platforms and noted their strengths and shortcomings.</p>
<p>A couple graphs from our survey results and an <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kqJsmXE=/?moveToWidget=3074457350004413430&cot=12" target="_blank">affinity diagram</a> from our user research and competitive analysis notes are shown below. We used the affinity diagram to organize and identify our key findings.</p>

<h1>Understanding our stakeholders</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>We created three user personas highlighting the backgrounds, frustrations, and goals of the stakeholders we researched in their transitions to online learning.</p>

<div class="med-br"></div>


<h2>Redefining our stakeholders</h2>
<p>To create a more targeted solution, we decided to limit our stakeholder group to middle schoolers (± a few years). This was a good age group as many of our survey participants were middle school teachers and students, who often do small collaborative tasks in class.

<h1>Developing three different ideas</h1>


<div class="post-title-br"></div>


<p>Based on our research, we established three design criteria that we needed to address in our product. <b>We then brainstormed a list of <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kjksms8=/" target="_blank">100+ product</a> ideas that addressed these criteria, and took three of our favorite ideas and drafted them into lo-fi wireframes.</b> Each idea we chose focuses on one of the design criteria.</p>

<div class="one-third-gallery">
  <div>
    <p><b>Technology</b></p>
    <p>Our product should take advantage of virtual learning by including various collaborative features to enhance group work.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>Communication</b></p>
    <p>Our product must allow teachers to effectively communicate with students and monitor student collaboration.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>Learnability</b></p>
    <p>Our product must be easy to learn and require little prior training to use.</p>

<h1>Combining ideas + Wireframes</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>We decided to take the notable features of each idea and combined them into one design. We created two <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kkjzJk0=/" target="_blank">user flows</a> outlining how a student and a teacher may potentially use our product, and drew out wireframes of our ideas.</p>

<h1>Final Mockup</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>Our final mockup has a similar structure as the wireframes, but improves on some buttons and other features in the sidebar. For the visual design, we wanted something simple and monochromatic, so we decided on a blue color scheme against a light-colored background.<!-- Our prototype for the teacher's view of Homeroom can be found--></p>

<h1>Improvements and future steps</h1>
<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>To improve Homeroom, my team performed a cognitive walkthrough exercise, where we noted any learnability issues users may experience with our product. We found a few issues with confusing buttons and other UI features and proposed ways to fix these issues. A list of the learnability issues we detected can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11w44Qjx-G5emzv08liL_yGLCrkLGBWJU/view" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, we also prepared documents that we would use for user testing, including a script, a consent form, and a task list for participants. If we have the opportunity in the future, we would use these documents to get feedback on how to improve our product. The documents we would use for teachers can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br-KgSEG3vCsxWRPBvgEZbLwF4bfEdp7KW_HDs_GjoQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, and for students can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aUQI39bHZUmoGEDATIgOFisHFRGNRA_Cl8hq0I_jqg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>What I learned</h1>
  <div class="post-title-br"></div>
  <p>As a class project, Homeroom gave me the chance to practice user research and UI design in a structured environment, with strict deadlines but also with the guidance of my professor and TA. I went through an organized empathize-define-ideate-prototype process and took on a variety of roles in the process. </p>
  <p>In particular, I enjoyed delving more into user research through this project. My experience with observing, surveying, and interviewing our stakeholders taught me not only a lot about our project topic but also helped me reflect on my personal experiences with virtual learning.</p>
  <p>Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project! I had really amazing teammates and we had a fun time working with each other.</p>
