<h1>The problem</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>This year, a lot of students and teachers have been thrown into virtual learning with little prior training or notice. Because of the transition, a lot of changes have been made to the way classes operate. Collaboration is an integral tool in classrooms, especially when students and teachers are living more isolated lives, but current technologies for virtual learning don't allow for the same collaborative experience that students get in classrooms. We wanted to create a tool that improves on virtual collaboration and makes it as easy and beneficial as in-person collaboration.</p>

<h1>User research</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>To create a helpful classroom tool, we had to get a better understanding of our main stakeholders: students, teachers, and administrators. We observed 4, interviewed 5, and surveyed 62 people across these stakeholder categories, focusing on comparing their online and in-person classroom experiences. We also did competitive analysis on a few video conferencing and collaboration platforms and noted their strengths and shortcomings.</p>
<p>A couple graphs from our survey results and an <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kqJsmXE=/?moveToWidget=3074457350004413430&cot=12" target="_blank">affinity diagram</a> from our user research and competitive analysis notes are shown below. We used the affinity diagram to organize and identify our key findings.</p>

<h1>Understanding our stakeholders</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>Based on the people we researched, we created three user personas highlighting the backgrounds, frustrations, and goals of our stakeholder groups during the transition to online learning.</p>

<br>

<div class="med-br"></div>


<h2>Redefining our stakeholders</h2>
<p>To create a more targeted solution, we decided to limit our stakeholder group to middle schoolers (± a few years). This was a good age group as many of our survey participants were middle school teachers and students, who often do small collaborative tasks in class.

<h1>Developing three different ideas</h1>


<div class="post-title-br"></div>


<p>Based on our research, we established three design criteria that we needed to address in our product. We then brainstormed a list of <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kjksms8=/" target="_blank">100+ product</a> ideas that addressed these criteria, and took three of our favorite ideas and drafted them into lo-fi wireframes. Each idea we chose focuses on one of the design criteria.</p>

<br>
<br>

<div class="one-third-gallery">
  <div>
    <p><b>Technology</b></p>
    <p>Our product should take advantage of virtual learning by including various collaborative features to enhance group work.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>Communication</b></p>
    <p>Our product must allow teachers to effectively communicate with students and monitor student collaboration.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>Learnability</b></p>
    <p>Our product must be easy to learn and require little prior training to use.</p>

<h1>Combining ideas + Wireframes</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>We decided to take the notable features of each idea and combined them into one design. We created two <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kkjzJk0=/" target="_blank">user flows</a> outlining how a student and a teacher may potentially use our product, and drew out wireframes of our ideas.</p>

<h1>Final Mockup</h1>

<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>Our final mockup has a similar structure as the wireframes, but improves on some buttons and other features in the sidebar. For the visual design, we wanted something simple and monochromatic, so we decided on a medium blue color scheme against a light-colored background.<!-- Our prototype for the teacher's view of Homeroom can be found--> Here are a few of the key screens we worked on.</p>

<h1>Improvements and future steps</h1>
<div class="post-title-br"></div>

<p>To improve Homeroom, my team performed a cognitive walkthrough exercise, where we went through the main interactions users would have with our product and noted any learnability issues. We found a few issues with confusing buttons and other UI features and proposed ways to fix these issues. A list of the learnability issues we detected can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11w44Qjx-G5emzv08liL_yGLCrkLGBWJU/view" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, we also prepared documents that we would use for user testing, including a script, a consent form, and a task list for participants. If we have the opportunity in the future, we would use these documents to get feedback on how to improve our product. The documents we would use for teachers can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br-KgSEG3vCsxWRPBvgEZbLwF4bfEdp7KW_HDs_GjoQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, and for students can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aUQI39bHZUmoGEDATIgOFisHFRGNRA_Cl8hq0I_jqg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>What I learned</h1>
  <div class="post-title-br"></div>
  <p>As a class project, Homeroom gave me the chance to practice user research and UI design in a structured environment, with strict deadlines but also with the guidance of my professor and TA. I went through an organized empathize-define-ideate-prototype-test process and took on a variety of roles in the process. </p>
  <p>In particular, I enjoyed delving more into user research through this project. My experience with observing, surveying, and interviewing our stakeholders taught me not only a lot about our project topic but also about my personal experiences with virtual learning. I was also able to learn a lot about the technicalities of user research, from creating consent forms to learning about the limitations of researching minors.</p>
  <p>Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project! I had really amazing teammates and we had a fun time working with each other. It was cool to be able to explore current issues with remote education and think outside the box to come up with a solution. </p>
