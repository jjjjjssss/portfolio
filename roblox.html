      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Over the summer of 2022, I was a design intern at Roblox, a popular game platform and game creation system with
        over 230 million registered users. As a member of the <b>collaboration team</b>, I worked on improving the
        collaboration experience in Roblox Studio, the game creation tool for Roblox.</p>
      <p>Details and images for my projects have been omitted. If you would like to know more about this project, please

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Solving a shifting problem.</h2>
      <p>My main project was quite a ride. <b>The problem I was solving continuously shifted as I did more research and
          identified more opportunities and limitations in the collaboration space.</b> I worked and learned through
        this project alongside a product management intern, guided by our two managers.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Problem (Version 1): How do we help collaborators know when they have been invited to a file?</h2>
      <p>This was the initial problem our team had identified and presented to us. </p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>We led primary and secondary research to better understand collaboration in creators’ current workflows and
        identify potential areas of change.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="l-img" src="media/roblox/research.png" alt="Research">
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>User Flow, Ideation, & A Workshop</h3>
      <p>Based on our findings, we designed a user flow for the current process of recruiting, inviting, and onboarding
        collaborators. We then identified areas of opportunity within this process, which we translated into solution
        ideas (+ lo-fi wireframes).</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="l-img" src="media/roblox/user-flow.png" alt="User Flow">
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <p>I then led a workshop with engineers to get early feedback on our research, ideas, and how they aligned with
        the vision of our team.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Problem shift: Our solution would be handled by another team.</h2>
      <p>After the workshop, one strong solution quickly emerged: <b>sending collaboration-related notifications to
          creators.</b> For the next week, we looked into the most suitable channels and frequencies for different
        notification content. </p>
      <p>We then reached out to the team that works on notifications, who let us know that they would handle our
        solution from there. To deliver our recommendations to the team, we prepared a detailed guide they could refer
        to.</p>

      <img class="l-img" src="media/roblox/notification-chart.png" alt="Notification Information Chart">
      <div class="s-space"></div>
      <p>But now, <b>with our initial solution unexpectedly out of our control,</b> we were restless interns with more
        time to spare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Problem (Version 2): How do we surface more collaboration information on the start screen?</h2>
      <p>So, we decided to turn our focus to a product our team had access to: the start screen (landing screen of
        Roblox Studio, where creators can access their files). Our earlier research findings and continued research
        helped inform how we would surface more collaboration information on this screen.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Ideas</h3>
      <img class="l-img" src="media/roblox/wireframes.png" alt="Collaboration Wireframes">
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>A few of these solutions required us to prioritize different types of collaboration information. One activity
        we ran during our 5 user testing sessions was asking users to rank these in a tier list.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Problem shift: How can we think beyond collaboration?</h2>
      <p>While we were working on collaboration information, our team and adjacent teams brought up <b>broader issues
          they’d identified in the start screen.</b> We began brainstorming ideas for these issues, and as we continued
        research and testing for the rest of the project, we consulted users and validated some of the ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Problem (Version 3): How do we improve the organization of the start screen as a whole?</h2>
      <p>The biggest start screen issue was the information architecture—the navigation menu was misleading, files were
        hard to find, and frequented files were not prioritized. In a long-term solutions document, we addressed this
        with the ideas we tested and validated. We also created a short-term solutions document with a timeline for more
        immediate fixes.</p>
      <p>This outlines some of the areas we tackled in the start screen.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Start Screen Changes</h3>

      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Final Presentation</h3>
      <p>In my final presentation for my internship, I presented these long-term solutions as a North Star design vision
        for the start screen and identified design principles to follow with future start screen improvements.</p>
      <img class="l-img" src="media/roblox/presentation.png" alt="Final Presentation">
    </div>


    <div class="section gray-bg">
      <h2>Side Project: List Mode</h2>
      <p>As a side project, I helped lead design support for another improvement to the start screen: a list view for
        files! This would enable creators to access more information about files and improve their file management.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>UI Improvements</h3>
      <p>I was recruited to this project a month after engineers began working on it to give feature and UI suggestions.
        This shows the original screen I was handed and the new suggestions I made.</p>

      <h3>Notable Contributions</h3>

      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Beta Release and Implementing Feedback</h3>
      <p>We first released list mode to the community in beta, which was positively received in DevForum, a discussion
        platform for Roblox creators. See the DevForum posts here: <a
          href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/list-mode-for-studio-beta-release/1888575" target="_blank">Beta
          Release</a> / <a

          target="_blank">Full Release</a></p>
      <p>We also noted some constructive feedback which we improved on for the full release.</p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges I stumbled upon during this project was <b>engineering limitations</b>. From
        sacrificing good designs for ones that are easier to implement, to eliminating certain features because we
        didn’t have the infrastructure to back them up, I learned that designing can’t always be about what the designer
        thinks is right.</p>
      <p>I also <b>worked without an established design system</b>, which meant that I had to look for existing
        components and assets in Roblox Studio’s interface and copy them to the best of my degree. This added some
        complexity to my design work and meant that I had to spend a lot more time explaining design details to
        engineers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Learning Points</h2>
      <p>My internship experience challenged me in ways I’d never experienced before. For one, Roblox encouraged interns
        to work autonomously, and we were the ones who drove projects forward, determined next steps, and actively
        reached out for help.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Embrace change.</h3>
      <p>By learning to sacrifice old work to push our project in new directions, I grew more flexible and resilient as
        a designer. But at the same time, I knew to stand my ground if there were any ideas I truly wanted to push
        forward.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Understand your team and their vision.</h3>
      <p>Some of our earlier ideas were met with mixed reviews from our team. We quickly learned how important it was to
        align on our team’s background and values to drive ideas towards their vision.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>An amazing summer &#9728;&#65039;</h3>
      <p>Looking back, I had an amazing time working with my team and fellow design interns. Beyond just projects, I had
        so many opportunities to bond with these amazing people, and I’m glad I made the most of it. These are some of
        my favorite memories from this summer!</p>
