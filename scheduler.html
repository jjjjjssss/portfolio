    <div class="section">
      <div class="tag">Overview</div>
      <h2>GT Scheduler: Improving the course registration process</h2>
      <p>Course registration is a stressful experience for many students at Georgia Tech, exacerbated by the
        school’s outdated course registration tools. As a result, many students rely on third-party scheduling
        tools, such as GT Scheduler, developed by former student Jason Park. </p>
      <p>To help maintain this app, my team of 12 at <a href="https://bitsofgood.org/" target="_blank">Bits of
          Good</a> was tasked to make improvements and add new features to the scheduler.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Existing features</h3>
      <p>Currently, GT Scheduler features two main pages:</p>
      <div class="featured-text">A <b>calendar view</b> to plan out weekly class times.</div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">A <b>map view</b> to see where the locations of classes compare to each other.</div>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/calendarview.png" alt="Calendar View">
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/mapview.png" alt="Map View">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>New features by our team</h3>
      <p>While GT Scheduler currently provides basic tools for schedule planning, our team wanted to add new
        features to further streamline this process. Over the semester, we worked on three new features:</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">A <b>course catalog</b> with advanced searching and filtering capabilities and
        detailed information on each course. </div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">A <b>feedback widget</b> to share ideas, feedback, or questions about the
        scheduler.</div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">The ability to create <b>multiple schedules</b> for one semester so students can
        try out different schedule plans. </div>
    </div>


    <div class="section gray-bg">
      <div class="tag">Feature 1</div>
      <div class="tag">Overview</div>
      <h2>1. Course Catalog: Overview</h2>
      <p>The primary feature our team worked on was the course catalog, where students can search for courses and
        view detailed course information. This enables students to not only plan schedules but also research the
        courses they want to take.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>A centralized space for course details</h3>
      <p>The course catalog consolidates essential course information, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a course description,</li>
        <li>prerequisites,</li>
        <li>GPA breakdowns for the entire course and individual professors,</li>
        <li>the number of seats available in a course's sections and waitlists, and</li>
        <li>location and times of each section.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/final.png" alt="Course Catalog">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>Advanced searching and filtering capabilities</h3>
      <p>To make it easier to find the specific course students want, the catalog has an advanced filtering system
        to filter by credit hours, class times, delivery mode, and campus location.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/searching.png" alt="Searching and Filtering">
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div class="tag">User research</div>
      <h2>Identifying user needs</h2>
      <p>The idea of a course catalog came from the previous team that worked on GT Scheduler, who observed that
        students cross-referenced 2-3 different resources while scheduling. To learn more, my design partner and I
        <b>interviewed six Georgia Tech students</b> about their registration experience.
      </p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Preferences of a typical student</h3>
      <p>Based on the interviews, we constructed an archetype of how a typical student approaches registration.
      </p>
      <div class="featured-text">
        <p style="margin-top:0"><b>Registration Process:</b> The student typically has a flexible 4-year plan laid out
          for core courses,
          but is willing to explore different electives. When choosing courses, they prioritize:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0">
          <li>good professors</li>
          <li>class style and difficulty (such as the average course GPA and the professor’s teaching style)</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0">course prerequisites</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">
        <p style="margin-top:0"><b>Tools and Functions:</b> Common tools they use for registration include:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:0">
          <li>OSCAR: the official Georgia Tech registration platform</li>
          <li>Course Critique: displays the historical GPA for each course and each professor</li>
          <li>Rate My Professors/Reddit: places where students leave reviews about their professors</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0">DegreeWorks: where students go to see if their courses meet the
            requirements for their major</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>User needs</h3>
      <p>From these interviews, we also identified four main needs that our course catalog should fulfill.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">Students should be able to view <b>basic information</b> like course prerequisites,
        number of credit hours, and class location.</div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">Students should have information to help them choose between course sections based on
        <b>professor difficulty and class times</b>.
      </div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">Students should be able to easily identify when courses have <b>conflicting times</b>.
      </div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">Students should be able to <b>filter</b> for courses based on time, location,
        and other preferences.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="tag">Secondary Research</div>
      <h2>Drawing from related tools</h2>
      <p>We also analyzed common registration tools brought up in the user
        interviews and reached out to students at other schools to recommend their favorite schedulers.</p>
      <p>Keeping user needs in mind, we picked out features from each of these tools to incorporate into our course
        catalog.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>OSCAR → Course sections table</h3>
      <p>OSCAR is the official Georgia Tech platform for registration, where they can view detailed information about
        course sections. However, the outdated interface and confusing navigation are frustrating for students to use.
      </p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/oscar1.png" alt="OSCAR">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>Course Critique → Average GPAs</h3>
      <p>Course Critique compiles the historical course GPAs of all Georgia Tech courses and professors. Many
        students rely on this to evaluate the difficulty of their courses.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/coursecritique.png" alt="Course Critique">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>Penn Course Plan → Search and filter</h3>
      <p>Penn Course Plan is a student-created scheduler for the University of Pennsylvania. This scheduler not has an
        effective search and filtering tool, but also condenses a course catalog and calendar view on one screen.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/penncourseplan.png" alt="Penn Course Plan">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>QuACS → Course description</h3>
      <p>Like Penn Course Plan, QuACS is a student-created scheduler for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. It has
        a separate course catalog that lists out course descriptions and course sections, and courses can be
        added to the calendar view directly via the catalog.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <div class="gallery double-gallery">
        <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/quacs1.png" alt="QuACS">

      </div>
    </div>



    <div class="section gray-bg">
      <div class="tag">Wireframes</div>
      <div class="tag">User Flow</div>
      <h2>The drawing board</h2>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>With a better understanding of potential features for the catalog, we started brainstorming ideas for the
        page’s layout. We explored three types of ways to integrate the catalog into the scheduler.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="xl-img" src="media/scheduler/wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>User Flow</h3>
      <p>To clarify to ourselves and our developers how users would navigate through the catalog, we created and
        updated a user flow throughout this project, with a focus on searching and filtering.
      </p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/userflow.png" alt="User Flow">
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div class="tag">User Feedback</div>
      <h2>A second opinion</h2>
      <div class="featured-text">Do we need a separate course catalog page?</div>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <p>While designing the wireframes and user flow, our team started having some doubts—<b>we felt that course
          information could be best displayed as a popup in the current calendar view without the need for a separate
          course catalog.</b></p>
      <p>We asked users from the previous interviews on their thoughts. They still preferred the separate course
        catalog, because they saw themselves using the calendar view and catalog view for two distinct tasks: organizing
        class times versus learning about courses.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="tag">Wireframes</div>
      <h2>Iterations</h2>
      <p>With the user feedback in mind, we continuously refined our designs for a standalone catalog page. We
        sought feedback on our designs through weekly design critiques with other designers in Bits of Good and
        a mid-semester demo to the organization’s product team.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>

    </div>



    <div class="section gray-bg">
      <div class="tag">Mockups</div>
      <h2>The final solution</h2>
      <p>Through multiple iterations, we refined our design to meet the user needs we identified at the user
        research phase.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Students should be able to view basic information like course prerequisites, number of credit hours, and
        class location.</h3>
      <p>This information is condensed into tables that reflect the familiar interface of Georgia Tech’s official
        registration platform, but we eliminated unimportant columns and made the UI more scannable.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/final.png" alt="Final Mockup">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>Students should have information to help them choose between course sections based on professor difficulty and
        class times.</h3>
      <p>The page displays historical GPAs and grade breakdowns for entire courses and specific professors. The catalog's
        table view makes it easy to compare class times.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/solution2.png" alt="Grade Distribution">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>Students should be able to easily identify when courses have conflicting times.</h3>
      <p>Course sections that conflict with a student’s current schedule are grayed out.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/solution3.png" alt="Grayed Out Sections">
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>Students should be able to search and filter for courses based on time, location, and other preferences.
      </h3>
      <p>Users can expand the search bar to access specific search filters like class times, credit hours,
        delivery mode, and campus location.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/solution4.png" alt="Search and Filter">
      <div class="m-space"></div>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div class="tag">Looking forward</div>
      <h2>Future features for the catalog</h2>
      <p>The catalog designs successfully tackle the basic needs of researching courses. In order to make this an
        even more comprehensive platform for course registration, our team brainstormed some future features for
        the catalog.</p>
      <p>Based on other tools students use for course registration:</p>

      <div class="featured-text">Displaying <b>professor reviews and ratings</b> by students from Rate My
        Professors</div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text">Incorporate a <b>syllabi uploading and sharing</b> functionality</div>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>

      <p>Other features:</p>
      <div class="featured-text">A <b>course tracking and notification system</b> for students to receive updates
        on course and waitlist availability</div>
      <div class="xxs-space"></div>
      <div class="featured-text"><b>User accounts</b> that enable students to enter their major and previous
        courses to see if they have fulfilled prerequisites and highlight courses they still need to take</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section gray-bg">
      <div class="tag">Feature 2</div>
      <h2>2. Feedback Widget</h2>
      <p>Previously, to collect feedback on GT Scheduler, our team relied on a combination of Google Analytics,
        Google Forms, and word of mouth. We looked into a more direct way to collect this feedback.</p>
      <div class="s-space"></div>

      <h3>Ideation</h3>
      <p>We identified two key inputs for the feedback widget: one rating system to measure the scheduler's
        performance, and one text input for comments. We mocked up a few ways to display these fields.
      </p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <div class="gallery triple-gallery">
        <img src="media/scheduler/feedbackwidgetidea1.png" class="Feedback Widget Idea">
        <img src="media/scheduler/feedbackwidgetidea2.png" class="Feedback Widget Idea">
        <img src="media/scheduler/feedbackwidgetidea3.png" class="Feedback Widget Idea">
      </div>
      <div class="m-space"></div>

      <h3>Final design</h3>
      <p>Users can select the feedback button on the bottom right of the scheduler page to open up the feedback
        form.</p>
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/feedbackwidget.png" class="Feedback Widget">
      <div class="xs-space"></div>
      <p>Not long after we implemented the feedback form, we received 30+ responses from students, including
        feature suggestions, bug reports, and pain points we could use in future improvements to the scheduler.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <div class="tag">Feature 3</div>
      <h2>3. Multiple schedules</h2>
      <p>A lot of students had requested for the ability to create multiple schedules for their alternative plans.
        We added a small functionality for creating, deleting, and renaming new schedules.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="tag">Reflection</div>
      <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
      <p>This project was one of my first times working in a cross-functional team. While I mostly just worked with the
        other designer in the beginning, I began to collaborate more with the product manager to discuss user needs and
        product requirements, and with the engineering manager and developers to understand the feasibility of our
        designs.</p>
      <p>This project helped me gain a better understanding of my role as a designer—the bridge between product
        and engineering—and helped prepare me for my first internship that summer. I definitely grew a lot working on a
        real-world project with a direct impact on the students around me.</p>
