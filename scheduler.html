		<h2>GT Scheduler: Improving the course registration process</h2>
		<p>Course registration is a stressful experience for many students at Georgia Tech, exacerbated by the school’s outdated registration platform. To improve the registration process, GT Scheduler, a third-party registration tool developed by student Jason Park, provides a variety of features that allow students to plan out a course schedule, decide between professors and class sections, and preview information about a course. </p>
		<div class="s-space"></div>
		
		<h3>The team</h3>
		<p>I worked on improving this scheduler as a part of a cross-functional team in Bits of Good, a student organization that helps develop powerful web apps for nonprofits but also works on student-focused projects. Our team of one product manager, one engineering manager, two designers, and eight developers worked for one semester to make improvements and add new features to the scheduler. </p>
		<div class="s-space"></div>

		<h3>Existing features</h3>
		<p>Currently, GT Scheduler features two main views:</p>
		<div class="featured-text">A <b>calendar view</b> to plan out weekly class times.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">A <b>map view</b> to see where the locations of classes compare to each other.</div>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/calendarview.png" alt="Calendar View">
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/mapview.png" alt="Map View">
		<div class="caption">GT Scheduler allows students to add courses to their schedule plan and view different schedule configurations.</div>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>New features by our team</h3>
		<p>While GT Scheduler currently provides basic tools for schedule planning, our team wanted to add new features to further streamline this process. Over the semester, we worked on three new features:</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">A <b>course catalog</b> with advanced searching and filtering capabilities and detailed information on each course. </div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">A <b>feedback widget</b> to share ideas, feedback, or questions about the scheduler.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">The ability to create <b>multiple schedules</b> for one semester so students can try out different schedule plans. </div>
	</div>


	<div class="section gray-bg">
		<div class="tag">Project 1</div><div class="tag">Overview</div>
		<h2>1. Course catalog</h2>
		<p>The primary feature our team worked on was the course catalog, where students can search for courses and view detailed course information. This combines features of our school’s official course catalog, which has an outdated, difficult-to-navigate interface, with other common tools that students use for registration. By integrating the catalog in GT Scheduler, students would have a centralized platform to not only plan schedules but also research the courses they want to take.</p>
		<div class="s-space"></div>
		
		<h3>A centralized space for course details</h3>
		<p>The course catalog consolidates essential course information, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a course description,</li>
			<li>prerequisites,</li>
			<li>grade breakdowns for the entire course and individual professors,</li>
			<li>the number of seats available in a course's sections and waitlist, and</li>
			<li>location and times of each section,</li>
		</ul>
		<p>in an easy-to-navigate space.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/final.png" alt="Course Catalog">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Advanced searching and filtering capabilities</h3>
		<p>To make it easier to find the specific course students want, the catalog has an advanced filtering system to filter by credit hours, class times, delivery mode, and campus location.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/searching.png" alt="Searching and Filtering">
	</div>


	<div class="section">
		<div class="tag">User research</div>
		<h2>Identifying user needs</h2>
		<p>The idea of a course catalog came from the previous team that worked on GT Scheduler, who observed that students cross-referenced 2-3 different resources while scheduling. To delve further into this issue, my design partner and I <b>interviewed six Georgia Tech students</b> regarding information they look for during registration, resources they currently use, and how they might utilize a course catalog. Based on their responses, we identified the general preferences and needs of our target users.</p>
		<div class="s-space"></div>

		<h3>Preferences of a typical student</h3>
		<p>Based on the interviews, we constructed an archetype of how a typical student approaches registration.</p>
		<p><b>Registration Process:</b> The student typically has a flexible 4-year plan laid out for core courses, but is willing to explore different electives. Likewise, when registering, they first look for core courses, then choose other courses based on availability. They prioritize:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>good professors</li>
			<li>class style and difficulty (such as the average course GPA and the professor’s teaching style)</li>
			<li>course prerequisites</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Tools and Functions:</b> Common tools they use for registration include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>OSCAR:</b> the official Georgia Tech registration platform that displays course times, availability, prerequisites, and credit hours</li>
			<li><b>Course Critique:</b> displays the historical GPA for each course and each professor</li>
			<li><b>Rate My Professors/Reddit:</b> places where students leave reviews about their professors</li>
			<li><b>DegreeWorks:</b> where students go to see if their courses meet the requirements for their major</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="s-space"></div>

		<h3>User needs</h3>
		<p>From these interviews, we also identified four main needs that our course catalog should fulfill.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">Students should be able to view basic information like course prerequisites, number of credit hours, and class location.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">Students should have information to help them choose between different professors and course sections based on difficulty and class times.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">Students should be able to easily identify when courses have conflicting times.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">Students should be able to search and filter for courses based on time, location, and other preferences.</div>
	</div>

		<div class="tag">Secondary Research</div>
		<h2>Looking at related tools and what other schools do</h2>
		<p>In addition to identifying user needs, we also analyzed common registration tools brought up in the user interviews and reached out to students at other schools to ask about their schedulers. We then evaluated potential features we could refine and integrate into GT Scheduler.</p>
		<div class="s-space"></div>

		<h3>OSCAR</h3>
		<p>OSCAR is the official Georgia Tech platform for registration. For each course, students can view a table of all course sections and course details. While it contains a lot of detailed information, the outdated interface and difficult navigability are frustrating for students to use.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<div class="gallery double-gallery">
			<img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/oscar1.png" alt="OSCAR">
			<img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/oscar2.png" alt="OSCAR">
		</div>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Course Critique</h3>
		<p>Course Critique compiles the historical course GPAs of all Georgia Tech courses and professors. Many students rely on this to evaluate the difficulty of their courses.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/coursecritique.png" alt="Course Critique">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Penn Course Plan</h3>
		<p>Penn Course Plan is a student-created scheduler for the University of Pennsylvania. The scheduler is broken down into three sections: course search and details, a list of courses to add to the schedule, and a calendar. This interface effectively condenses a course catalog and calendar view on one screen.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/penncourseplan.png" alt="Penn Course Plan">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>QuACS</h3>
		<p>Like Penn Course Plan, QuACS is a student-created scheduler for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. It has a separate course catalog that lists out course descriptions and course sections, and courses can be added to the calendar view directly via the catalog.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>

		<div class="tag">Wireframes</div><div class="tag">User Flow</div>
		<h2>The drawing board</h2>
		<div class="s-space"></div>

		<h3>Wireframes</h3>
		<p>With a better understanding of potential features for the catalog, we started brainstorming ideas for the page’s layout, grouped into three ways to present information.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="xl-img" src="media/scheduler/wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>User Flow</h3>
		<p>To clarify to ourselves and our developers how users would navigate through the catalog, we created and updated a user flow throughout this project, focusing on the searching and filtering functionalities.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/userflow.png" alt="User Flow">
	</div>


	<div class="section">
		<div class="tag">User Feedback</div>
		<h2>A second opinion</h2>
		<div class="featured-text">Do we need a separate course catalog page?</div>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<p>While designing the wireframes and user flow, our team had some doubts about whether or not a separate course catalog page was necessary in the first place. <b>We felt that course information could be condensed or displayed as a popup in the current calendar view of GT Scheduler without the need for a separate course catalog.</b></p>
		<p>We asked users from the previous interviews on their thoughts on the two different ways to display information, one using the catalog and one without the catalog.</p>
		<p>The interviewees still preferred the separate course catalog. They saw themselves using the calendar view and catalog view for two distinct tasks, organizing class times versus learning about courses, and preferred the visual ease and clean design of an isolated catalog.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<div class="tag">Wireframes</div>
		<h2>Iterations</h2>
		<p>With the user feedback in mind, we continuously refined our designs for a standalone catalog page. We sought feedback on our designs through weekly design critiques with other designers in Bits of Good and a mid-semester demo to the organization’s product team.</p>

	<div class="section gray-bg">
		<div class="tag">Mockups</div>
		<h2>The final solution</h2>
		<p>Through multiple iterations, we refined our design to meet the user needs we identified at the user research phase.</p>
		<div class="s-space"></div>

		<h3>Students should be able to view basic information like course prerequisites, number of credit hours, and class location.</h3>
		<p>This information is condensed into tables that reflect the familiar interface of Georgia Tech’s official registration platform, but with a much cleaner look to help students quickly spot the information they need.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/scheduler/final.png" alt="Final Mockup">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Students should have information to help them choose between different professors and course sections based on difficulty and class times.</h3>
		<p>The page displays historical GPAs and grade breakdowns for entire courses and specific professors, and the table view makes it easy to compare class times.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/solution2.png" alt="Grade Distribution">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Students should be able to easily identify when courses have conflicting times.</h3>
		<p>Course sections that conflict with a student’s current schedule are grayed out.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/solution3.png" alt="Grayed Out Sections">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Students should be able to search and filter for courses based on time, location, and other preferences.</h3>
		<p>Users can expand the search bar to access specific search filters like class times, credit hours, delivery mode, and campus location.</p>

		<div class="tag">Looking forward</div>
		<h2>Future features for the catalog</h2>
		<p>The catalog designs successfully tackle the basic needs of researching courses. In order to make this an even more comprehensive platform for course registration, our team brainstormed some future features for the catalog.</p>
		<p>Based on common tools and resources that students use for course registration:</p>

		<div class="featured-text">Displaying <b>professor reviews and ratings</b> by students from Rate My Professors</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">Incorporate a <b>syllabi uploading and sharing</b> functionality</div>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>

		<p>Other features:</p>
		<div class="featured-text">A <b>course tracking and notification system</b> for students to receive updates on course and waitlist availability</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text"><b>User accounts</b> that enable students to enter their major and previous courses to see if they have fulfilled prerequisites and highlight courses they still need to take</div>
	</div>

	<div class="section gray-bg">
		<div class="tag">Project 2</div>
		<h2>2. Feedback Widget</h2>
		<p>Previously, to collect feedback on GT Scheduler, our team relied on a combination of Google Analytics, Google Forms, and word of mouth. For our second project, we looked into a more direct way to encourage and collect this feedback.</p>
		<div class="s-space"></div>

		<h3>Ideation</h3>
		<p>We identified two elements needed in the feedback widget: one rating system to measure the scheduler's performance, and one for users to leave text comments. We mocked up a few ways to display these fields.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<div class="gallery triple-gallery">
			<img src="media/scheduler/feedbackwidgetidea1.png" class="Feedback Widget Idea">
			<img src="media/scheduler/feedbackwidgetidea2.png" class="Feedback Widget Idea">
			<img src="media/scheduler/feedbackwidgetidea3.png" class="Feedback Widget Idea">
		</div>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Final design</h3>
		<p>Users can select the feedback button on the bottom right of the scheduler page to open up the feedback form.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/scheduler/feedbackwidget.png" class="Feedback Widget">
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<p>Not long after we implemented the feedback form, we received 30+ responses from students, including feature suggestions, bug reports, and descriptions of pain points we could use in future improvements to the scheduler.</p>
	</div>


	<div class="section">
		<div class="tag">Project 3</div>
		<h2>3. Multiple schedules</h2>
		<p>A lot of students had requested for the ability to create multiple schedules for their alternative plans. We added a small functionality for creating, deleting, and renaming new schedules.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>

		<div class="tag">Reflection</div>
		<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
		<p>This project was one of my first times working in a cross-functional team, where tasks were clearly divided between product ideation and management, design, and development. I initially enjoyed the isolated nature of my role, that I could focus purely on design work while the rest of my team worked on other tasks. However, I quickly realized that despite the isolated roles, cross-functional teams are still strongly collaborative. I began working more with the product manager to discuss user needs and product requirements, and with the engineering manager and developers to understand the feasibility of our designs. This project helped me gain a better understanding of my role as a designer—the bridge between product and engineering—and helped prepare me for my Lacework internship that summer where I played a similar role in my team. This was a great start to my experience as a designer at Bits of Good, and I definitely got to grow a lot working on a real-world project with a direct impact on the students around me.</p>
