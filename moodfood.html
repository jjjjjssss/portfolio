    <h2>A week-long challenge</h2>

		<!-- <div class="xs-space"></div> -->
		<p>I received this prompt as part of a design challenge from an internship application. For 6 days, I took to the people around me to hear their thoughts on reading, their moods, and their interests, and worked them together to design a mobile app I call MoodFood.</p>
		<p>I designed five mocks with a variety of features to get users excited about micro-novels. While the time constraint was demanding, this project taught me how to prioritize, conduct rapid research and iterations, and make quick decisions.</p>

		<h2>Day 1: What do I need to know first?</h2>
		<div class="s-space"></div>
		<h3>Mood, recommendations, and engagement</h3>
		<p>Prior to beginning any research, I took some time to ask questions about recommendation apps and user needs. What problems is the app seeking to address? What do users want to gain from using the app? How do we encourage users to use this app?</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/moodfood/about-problem.png" alt="Questions about the problem space">
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<p>Mobile apps rely on consistent usage. I knew that engaging and retaining users, especially if I was trying to help them establish reading habits, would benefit both the app and the users. As a result, <b>creating valuable product engagement was a key focus for this project</b>.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/moodfood/product-engagement.png" alt="Questions about product engagement">
		<div class="m-space"></div>
		<h3>Target audience</h3>
		<p>The design challenge prompt never defined my target audience, so I chose to target one group to reduce the scope of my project (and save time!). I chose <b>older teens and young adults</b> for the following reasons:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They grew up around electronic devices and social media, making them optimal users for short, digital reads.</li>
			<li>It would be easier to interview the college students around me due to my constraints.</li>
		</ol>

		<div class="tag">User Research</div>
		<h2>Day 2: A quick survey with college students</h2>
		<p>Because of my time limitations, the most effective way for me to answer my questions was through a survey. I sent one out to college students regarding reading habits, how they consume content under different moods, and experiences with related apps. These were my conclusions after 21 responses:</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<h3>1. Yes, this app is a good idea.</h3>
		<p>Most people read (articles, stories) for short periods of time, multiple times in a day, on their phones in the comfort of their homes. This validates that there is a niche for quick reads on mobile devices.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>

		</div>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<h3>2. Decreasing the burden of finding and finishing reads + increasing community discussion = good product engagement.</h3>
		<p>Firstly, reading feels like a commitment; people cite being busy, having a low attention span, getting distracted, and struggling to pick out a book as blockers. A respondent constrasts this with how quick and noncommittal it feels to open up YouTube and pick out a video to watch.</p>
		<p>Secondly, people regularly engage in online and in-person discussions for the content they enjoy. Enabling discussion and a sense of community would be a way to increase product engagement.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<h3>3. How users’ moods can inform our recommendations.</h3>
		<p>When people are in a positive mood, they prefer uplifting, funny, and hobby-related content. When people are in a negative mood, they prefer both sad content or funny, warm, and thought-provoking content. And this takes us to our next section…</p>

		<h2>Days 3-6: Perfecting the personalized experience</h2>
		<div class="s-space"></div>
		<h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
		<p>How do we create and present tailored recommendations for users? To understand this a little better, I looked at book recommendation apps like GoodReads and Likewise.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/moodfood/competitor-1.png" alt="Competitors: GoodReads and Likewise">
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<p>These apps use discovery features that push the most suitable books for users based on what they had read previously and what genres they expressed interest in during the app onboarding. </p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/moodfood/competitor-2.png" alt="Competitors: Onboarding">
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<p>Based on my prompt and competitor research, I identified four factors that would determine a recommendation.</p>
		<!-- <ul>
			<li>Constant factors: Things that stay somewhat constant, which includes <b>preferred genres</b> and <b>reading history</b>. The user first sets this during onboarding, and the app will automatically adjust it as the user keeps reading and rating micro-novels.</li>
			<li>Dynamic factors: Things that change daily, which includes <b>mood</b> and <b>preferred reading time</b>. I need a way for users to enter this information daily without feeling too invasive.</li>
		</ul> -->
		<div class="featured-text">Constant factors: Things that stay somewhat consistent, which includes <b>preferred genres</b> and <b>reading history</b>. The user should first set this during onboarding, and the app will automatically adjust them as the user keeps reading and rating micro-novels.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text">Dynamic factors: Things that change daily, which includes <b>mood</b> and <b>preferred reading time</b>. I need a way to request this information daily without being too invasive.</div>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Pages to prioritize</h3>
		<p>With my research in mind, I created a user flow that incorporates onboarding, a home page for recommendations, and pages to increase product engagement. I highlighted five distinct pages that I would focus on for this project.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/moodfood/user-flow.png" alt="User Flow">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Page 1: Onboarding - Preferences</h3>
		<div class="gallery moodfood-gallery">
			<div>
				<p class="first-p">For many of our competitors, a short onboarding process is an effective way to a create personalized experience. MoodFood asks for preferred genres/subgenres on one page (and prior reading history on the following).</p>
				<p>Visually, I kept this page simple to reduce the cognitive burden of onboarding. Originally, I wanted to display the genres as a grid, but putting them in a list made it easier to display sub-genres.</p>

		<p></p>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Page 2: Today Page</h3>
		<div class="gallery moodfood-gallery">
			<div>
				<p class="first-p">The “today page,” or the home page, houses the main functionality of the app: a user can enter their moods, preferred genre-of-the-day, and preferred reading time, and the app generates recommendations.</p>
				<p>The first half of the page shows “top reads” for the user’s mood, interests, and reading history, and the second half shows a list of micro-novels categorized by ways to handle their mood.</p>
				<p class="last-p">There were a few visual iterations I played around with, one being a full screen popup for entering mood and a separate page for displaying recommendations. However, this felt invasive, so I opted for a small, expandable card on the same page as the recommendations.</p>
				<img style="width:65%;" src="media/moodfood/today-wireframes.png" alt="Today Page - Old Wireframes">
			</div>
			<img class="restrict-height mobile-gif" style="max-height:100vh;" src="media/moodfood/today-page.png" alt="Today Page">
		</div>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Page 3: Micro-Novel Page</h3>
		<div class="gallery moodfood-gallery">
			<div>
				<p class="first-p">This is the page where the user actually reads the micro-novel. The top of the page displays general information about the micro-novel, and below that, users can read a short description before jumping into the actual text.</p>
				<p class="last-p">Besides just the micro-novel, this page includes a community discussion tab and an additional recommendations tab to keep users engaged longer.</p>
			</div>
			<img class="restrict-height mobile-gif" src="media/moodfood/micro-novel.png" alt="Micro-Novel Page">
		</div>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>How these features reduce the burden of reading</h3>
		<p>In these three pages, my biggest goal was to decrease the pressure of finding and finishing a micro-novel. MoodFood accomplishes this in a few ways.</p>
		<div class="featured-text"><b>Onboarding: </b>Instead of making users hunt for micro-novels, onboarding gathers just enough information to create good recommendations.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text"><b>Today page > "Top reads for you": </b>This section catches the user's attention immediately and lowers the time between opening the app and finding something to read.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text"><b>Micro-novel page: </b>The page tells how long a micro-novel will take to read, and gives the option of saving it for later. This eliminates the burden of reading the micro-novel immediately.</div>

		<div class="tag">Style Guide</div>
		<h2>Note on visual design</h2>
		<p>Before starting on my hi-fis, I brainstormed a simple style guide for font and color styles. I wanted to keep the interface simple, and chose a sans-serif font with one accent color.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/moodfood/style-guide.png" alt="Style Guide">

	<div class="section gray-bg">
		<div class="tag">Secondary Research</div><div class="tag">Mockups</div>
		<h2>Days 3-6: Keeping users engaged</h2>
		<p>As I discovered through the survey, I couldn’t rely on users themselves to stay committed to their daily reads, and needed to design features to keep them engaged and motivated. A high product engagement not only helps users develop good habits, but helps the product by increasing its retention rate.</p>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>The importance of discussion</h3>
		<p>From my interviews, I found that <b>70% of interviewees engaged in in-person discussion, 60% engaged in online discussion, and 60% viewed fan-created content for their favorite content</b>. People love to give their opinions on content, from books to movies, YouTube videos, and news articles. These spaces foster areas for discussion, because discussion in and of itself is content.</p>
		<p>Being able to discuss content creates a sense of community. It helps people enjoy their content more and gives more of a reason to come back to the app.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="s-img" src="media/moodfood/survey-results-3.png" alt="Survey Results">
		<div class="m-space"></div>


		<h3>Page 4: Community Discussion</h3>
		<div class="gallery moodfood-gallery">
			<p>In MoodFood, each micro-novel has its own community page with a rating and commenting section.</p>
			<img class="restrict-height mobile-gif" src="media/moodfood/community.png" alt="Community Discussion">
		</div>
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>How do other apps create habit?</h3>
		<p>I also wanted to see how we could get users to come back to the app repeatedly until they developed a habit. For inspiration, I turned to a mood-tracking app I used in the past: Daylio, which not only visualizes users’ moods but encourages users to make tracking them a habit.</p>
		<div class="xs-space"></div>
		<img class="m-img" src="media/moodfood/competitor-3.png" alt="Daylio">
		<div class="m-space"></div>

		<h3>Page 5: Mood Tracker and Statistics</h3>
		<div class="gallery moodfood-gallery">
			<div>
				<p class="first-p">Unlike many of the other pages, the mood tracker and statistics page is not a critical feature. However, this page, inspired by Daylio, increases product engagement by providing users with a variety of evaluative features based on their moods and reading progress every week.</p>
				<p class="last-p">This page rewards habit and helps users be more mindful of their moods. It’s also another channel to push more micro-novel recommendations to users.</p>

		<div class="tag">Reflection</div>
		<h2>Looking back: What I learned and room for improvement</h2>
		<p>MoodFood was a great opportunity to see what I could research, explore, and refine in one week. Because the prompt was vague, I had a lot of freedom on how I wanted to approach the project. I learned to quickly extrapolate decisions from user research and developed unique features beyond the prompt.</p>
		<p>A few areas of improvement:</p>
		<div class="featured-text"><b>My pace:</b> Because I only had a week, I sped into hi-fis. Looking back, I should have spent more time testing and iterating on designs to produce more effective (even if unfinished) work.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>
		<div class="featured-text"><b>Interviews vs. surveys:</b> Although I needed qualitative answers from my research, I chose to do a survey due to time constraints. I think doing a couple interviews wouldn’t have affected my pace much, but could have increased the quality of my research.</div>
		<div class="xxs-space"></div>		
		<div class="featured-text"><b>Consider more user groups:</b> One big user group I didn’t consider was the authors of the micro-novels. In the future, I would like to envision what an interface for uploading micro-novels would look like.</div>
